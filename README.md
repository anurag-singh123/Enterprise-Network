**Project1: VLAN Network Topology with Voice Integration**
This project demonstrates a VLAN-based network topology segmented into three teams: HR, IT, and Finance, each with IP phones and PCs. The network is connected through a multilayer switch to a router, DNS server, and TFTP server. The topology is designed to ensure effective communication between devices within VLANs while maintaining network security and management efficiency.

**Project2: WAN Network**
The network topology in the image includes three routers interconnected via serial links, with each router connected to a switch that further connects to multiple PCs. The routers also have connections to external servers on different subnets, and a smartphone is linked to the first router's switch via a wireless connection. Each subnet has a distinct IP range, and the configuration suggests a segmented network with possible routing between different subnets.
